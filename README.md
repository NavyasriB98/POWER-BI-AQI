Data was collected from Dataful website.

2. Data Cleaning (Python)
Handled missing values, removed duplicates and unnecessary column which is not useful for analysis.
Converted data types and formatted inconsistent entries.
Cleaned data stored in data/cleaned/.

3. Data Modeling
Performed Data modelling by giving relations to all the tables in power bi.
created dimension tables for good accuracy.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (power bi)
Generated the required reports and key performance indicators useful for the stakeholders to understand 
Key insights derived and documented.

5. Data Visualization (Power BI)
Created interactive dashboards with:
KPIs
Trend analysis
Filters/slicers for user exploration

6. Data Validation
Generated insights has been rechecked with aqi index website .
